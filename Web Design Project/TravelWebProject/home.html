                            Hanoi is where imagination becomes reality.

                            One of many reasons why tourists love coming to Hanoi is because almost the entire city is covered with green trees. And, it has such diversity- from the old quarter to the urban areas.

                            Also, Hanoi is regarded as melting pot of Vietnam gastronomy. You can find all sorts of delicacies in this city which come in from other provinces.

                    <h3>Ho Chi Minh City</h3>
                    <div>
                        Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's undisputedly commercial headquarters with a keen sense of its own importance as Vietnam emerges from years of austerity to claim a place in the "Asian Tiger" economic slugfest.

                            Located on the Saigon River, Ho Chi Minh City or Saigon as it is still called by all, is Vietnam's major port and largest city, and still survives in wide downtown avenues flanked by pristine colonials. Thousands of expatriates and Vietnamese immigrants couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. They’ve long since fallen for the hidden charms of one of Southeast Asia’s most hectic, and eclectic, cities.

                  <div>
                        Speaking of Ha Long Bay, one must above all mention the beauty of its water and sky. Majestic and mysterious, inspiring and appealing: words alone cannot do justice to the natural wonders of this World Heritage Site.

                            With over 3 thousand incredible islands jutting out from the emerald waters of the Gulf of Tonkin that make up a vision of breathtaking beauty, Halong Bay is pure art and a priceless collection of unfinished sculptures hewn by the hand of nature.

                            Looking from above, Halong in our eyes appears to be an enormous and expressive picture of Mother Earth. By moving around, you feel as if you are walking in a fairyland with many petrified creatures surrounding you. There are rocks and even islets which form various extraordinary shapes—a Dragon, an Old Fisherman, and much more.

                             Other great mountains like Aurora & J, where Sa Pa sees the first rays of sun, make up a very steep valley.

                    <div>
                        Hoi An, once known as Faifo, with more than 2,000 years history, was the principal port of the Cham Kingdom, which controlled the strategic spice trade with Indonesia from the 7th to the 10th century and was a major international port in the 16th and 17th centuries 
                        <a id="more4"> More </a>

                            - and the foreign influences are discernible to this day.
                            The culture & heritage is mostly from the Cham people whose kingdom originally stretched from Hue South to Phan Thiet (South of Nha Trang) - the Champa's most likely originally from Java. The original Cham political capital was Tra Kieu, the commercial capital was Hoi An and the spiritual capital was My Son (Hindu).
                             The Cham people were Hindu, and by the 10th century the influence of Arab traders to Hoi An resulted in some converting to become Muslims.
                            The second major influence was from the Chinese, firstly from traders but especially the escaping Ming Dynasty armies who after settling in Hoi An for some years moved further south and created Saigon as a major trading port.
                            The third and last major influence of culture & heritage was from the Vietnamese and is fairly recent and only came after the Cham lost control of this area. For a tourist wanting Vietnamese culture & heritage, Hue is a much better destination than Hoi An (but the weather is much rougher too!).

                            Located on the bank of Song Huong- Perfume River; Hue, the capital of Thua Thien Hue province in Central Vietnam, is 700 km southern Hanoi, 1100km northern Ho Chi Minh City, and only a few miles from the sea. Not until 1945 was Hue the national capital, the political, cultural and religious center of Vietnam under the control of Nguyen Dynasty.
                             Most well-known for its historic values; Hue had been recognized as one of the World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

                           . Caffeine-aficionado heaven, the central area buzzes with dinky cafes where tables spill out onto the pavements – perfect for people watching.
                            Apart from the cafe culture, there's not actually much to do and most travellers only use Haiphong as a transport hop between the bus from Hanoi and the ferry to Cat Ba Island.
                             If you do decide to linger, you'll find a friendly town with minimal hassles that makes a relaxing change from Vietnam's main tourism centres.

                    <div>
                        Nowhere in Vietnam is changing as fast as Danang. For decades it had a reputation as a provincial backwater, but big changes are ongoing.

                        Stroll along the Han riverfront and you'll find gleaming new modernist hotels, and apartments and restaurants are emerging. Spectacular new bridges now span the Han river, and in the north of the city, the landmark new D-City is rising from the flatlands. Venture south and the entire China Beach strip is booming with hotel and resort developments.
                            That said, the city itself still has few conventional sightseeing spots, except for a very decent museum and a stunningly quirky bridge. So for most travellers, a few days enjoying the city’s beaches, restaurants and nightlife is probably enough. Book an after-dark tour to see Danang at its shimmering neon-lit best. The city's street food scene also deserves close investigation.
                            Danang also makes a great base for day trips. The city is part of a long thin peninsula, at the northern tip of which is Nui Son Tra (called Monkey Mountain by US soldiers). China Beach and the five Marble Mountains lie southwest of the city.

                             Long the Devil’s Island of Indochina, the preserve of political prisoners and undesirables, this place is now turning heads thanks to its striking natural beauty.
                             Con Son, the largest of this chain of 15 islands and islets, is ringed with lovely beaches, coral reefs and scenic bays, and remains partially covered in thick forests. In addition to hiking, diving and exploring empty coastal roads and deserted beaches, there are some excellent wildlife-watching opportunities such as the black giant squirrel and the endemic bow-fingered gecko.

                        The Ede name translates as ‘Thuot’s father’s village’, but Buon Ma Thuot has outgrown its rustic origins without acquiring any real charm.

                            An affluent, modern, but rather characterless city (pronounced ‘boon me tote’), it is inundated by traffic from three highways.
                            Its two saving graces are its museum and its coffee: the region grows some of the best in Vietnam, plenty of which is sold and drunk in town.
                             Buon Ma Thuot plays host to an annual Coffee Festival in March that sees gallons of the black nectar drunk and elephant races held in nearby Don village.
                            Most travellers stop in Buon Ma Thuot en route to the attractions around it: Yok Don National Park, a couple of striking waterfalls and heaps of minority villages. 
                            The province is home to 44 ethnic groups, the dominant groups being the Ede, Jarai, M’nong and Lao.
